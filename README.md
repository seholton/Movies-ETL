The goal of this analysis is to create automated data pipeline using the extract, transform and load (ETL) process. 
ETL_function_test.ipynb

Firstly, I created ETL_function_test.ipynb to extract data from JSON and CVS formats and transformed dats into a Pandas DataFrame. 

ETL_Clean_wiki_movies.ipynb

Step 2: I created ETL_Clean_wiki_movies.ipynb to go through the data, clean and reformat it. 

Clean_kaggle_data.ipynb

Next: I created the clean_kaggle_data.ipynb to clean the Kaggle Data, changing datatypes, and filling in missing values and dropping unwanted columns.
